## Comparison operators

Result of the expression is a boolean value.

```javascript
let a = 1;
console.log(a > 0);//result is boolean
console.log(a >= 0);//result is boolean
console.log(a < 1);//result is boolean
console.log(a <= 0);//result is boolean
console.log(a == 1);//value comparison
console.log(a === 1);//value and type comparison
console.log(a !== 1);//result is boolean

```
