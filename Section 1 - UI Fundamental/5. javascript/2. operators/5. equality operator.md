## Equality operator

```javascript
//Strict equality operator (Type + Value)
console.log(1 === 1);//true
console.log(1 === '1');//false

//Lose equality operator (Value)
console.log(1 == 1);//true

console.log(1 == '1');//true. Because it will automatically convert number 1 to string '1' and compare.

console.log(true == 1);//true. because it will convert 1 to a boolean which is true.
```

Most of the time we should use strict equality comparison because its more accurate.
