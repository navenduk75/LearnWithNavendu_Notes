## Bitwise operators

Not used often in real world.

In real life we use decimal systems to represent numbers like 1, 2, 3 etc.

But in computers these numbers are stored in binary format (bits => 0s and 1s).

Ex: 1 in decimal system is represented as seven 0s and one 1.
1 ==> 00000001
2 ==> 00000010

1 byte = 8 bits

Bitwise operators are similar to logical operators but they work on individual bit level.

```javascript
console.log(1 | 2);//Bitwise OR operator. Double vertical lines are logical OR operator.

// 1      ==> 00000001
// 2      ==> 00000010
// result ==> 00000011 (= 3) 

console.log(1 & 2);//Bitwise AND operator.

// 1      ==> 00000001
// 2      ==> 00000010
// result ==> 00000000 (= 0) 
```
