## Truthy and Falsy

They are not same as true and false. We can use them in a logical expression like true or false.

`Falsy values:`
undefined\
null\
0\
false\
''\
NaN

Anything thats not falsy is Truthy.

```javascript
console.log(false || 1 || 2);// 1 because it will stop when it finds first true or truthy value. This is also called Short-circuiting.
```

```javascript
//Example

let selectedColor = 'red';
let defaultColor = 'blue';
let color = selectedColor || defaultColor;
console.log(color);
```
