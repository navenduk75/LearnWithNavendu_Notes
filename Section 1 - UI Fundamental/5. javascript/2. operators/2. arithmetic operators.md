## Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform some mathematical calculations.

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 15;


console.log(a + b); //Addition operator

//Note: here a + b is called an Expression. Expression is something that produces a value.

console.log(a - b); //Subtraction operator
console.log(a * b); //Multiplication operator
console.log(a / b); //Divison operator
console.log(a % b); //Remainder of division operator
console.log(a ** b); //Exponentiation operator (x to the power of y)
```

`Increment (++):`
```javascript
console.log(a);//10
console.log(++a);//11. first incremented, then assigned

console.log(a++);//10. first assigned, then incremented. Same as a = a + 1
console.log(a);//11
```

`decrement (--):`
```javascript
console.log(a);//10
console.log(--a);//9. first decremented, then assigned

console.log(a--);//10. first assigned, then decremented
console.log(a);//9
```
