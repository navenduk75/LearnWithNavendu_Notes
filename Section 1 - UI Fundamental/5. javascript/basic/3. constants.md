## JavaScript Constants

Constants are variables whose value can't change. Value of regular variables can change.

```javascript
const interestRate = 0.7;
interestRate = 0.8;//error
console.log(interestRate);
```

Rule:
1. If you need to reassign, use `const` keyword
2. If you don't need to reassign, use `let` keyword
