## How to declare a variable?

```javascript
let name;
console.log(name); //undefined
```

```javascript
let name = 'Rahul Kumar';
console.log(name); //Rahul Kumar
```

## Rule for naming a variable
1. Can't be a keyword
2. Use meaningful and descriptive names
3. Can't start with a number
4. Can't contain space or hyphen
5. They are case sensitive

## Variable declaration

Camel Case: firstName

```javascript
let firstName, lastName;
```
```javascript
let firstName = "Rahul", lastName = "Kumar;
```
```javascript
//declare each variable in separate line
let firstName = "Rahul";
let lastName = "Kumar;
```
