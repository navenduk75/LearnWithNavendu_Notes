## Arrays
Array is a Data Structure used to store list of objects, like list of Person.

```javascript
let names = ['Rahul', 'Navendu'];//initialize array
console.log(names);

//Each element has an index that determines the position of that element in the array.
//Starts from 0.

//Use index to access the element
console.log(names[1]); //Navendu

//We can add new element because JavaScript is a dynamic language.
names[2] = 'Sachin';
console.log(names);

//Unlike other languages where all elements of an array must be of the same type,
//in javascript, we can store different types of data in the same array.
names[3] = 20;
console.log(names);
```

Technically, array is an object, just like person object we created earlier.  
This means, array will also have multiple properties which we can access using dot notation.


```javascript
console.log(typeof names); //"object"
console.log(names.length);
//Array has many properties we didn't create, but comes magically from somewhere (Prototype). :)
```
