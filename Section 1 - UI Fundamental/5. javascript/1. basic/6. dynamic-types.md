## Dynamic types

![Dynamic types](../images/6.%20Language%20types.png)

JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types. So, type of a varibale can change on runtime based on the type of data we assign to it.

```javascript
let data;       // Now data is undefined
data = 5;       // Now data is a Number
data = "Navendu";  // Now data is a String
```
```javascript
let name = "Rahul";
// Use typeof operator to check the type of a variable.
typeof name // "string"

name = 123;
typeof name // "number"
```
```javascript
let age = 20;
typeof age // "number"
age = 20.12;
typeof age // "number". Js doesn't have floating point numbers and int. Both are number.
```

```javascript
let isIndian = true;
typeof isIndian // "boolean"

let firstName = undefined;
typeof firstName // "undefined". undefined is also a type as well as value

let selectedMovie = null;
typeof selectedMovie // "object". We will see later.
```
